### Guidelines / Tips for Adding Translations

-   Only add translations for things you are 100% sure about. You don't have to translate everything, partially translating files is fine as well.
-   Quality > quantity.
-   If you are unsure about a translation, leave it blank. It is better to have a blank translation than a wrong one.
-   Feel free to join our [Discord](https://discord.gg/FyH6Z34vcZ) if you have any questions!
